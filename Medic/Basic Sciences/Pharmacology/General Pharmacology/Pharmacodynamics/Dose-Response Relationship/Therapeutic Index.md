- Therapeutic Index ($T_i$) is a relationship between $TD_{50}$ & $ED_{50}$ of a drug. Also called therapeutic ratio
- Mathematically $T_i$ can be calculated as the ratio between
	- $LD_{50}$ & $ED_{50}$ or $TD_{50}$ & $ED_{50}$

# Features
- Must be more than 1 for therapeutic use
- The more the $T_i$ the safer the drug
- The gap between the therapeutic effect and the adverse effect in Dose-Response Curve defines the safety margin or the $T_i$
