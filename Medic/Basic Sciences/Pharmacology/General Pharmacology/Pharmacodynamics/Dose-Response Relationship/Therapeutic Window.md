>a range between minimum effective concentrations(MEC) & the minimum toxic concentration(MTC) or the maximal acceptable adverse effect

The levels of drugs should always be between MEC and MTC in order to provide risk free therapeutic effects
- If any drug crosses MTC then it will cause toxic effects
- If it is unable to surpass MEC then there will be therapeutic failure
