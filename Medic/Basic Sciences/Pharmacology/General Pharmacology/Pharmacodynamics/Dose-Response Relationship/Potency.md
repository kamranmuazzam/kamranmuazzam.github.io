- a measure of the dose to produce a response (e.g. $ED_{50}$)
- A drug that produces greater effect at lower dose is more potent, needed in smaller doses
- Compared by $ED_{50}$ values
- Determined by affinity of a drug for its receptor
- Potency & [[Efficacy]] - independent of each other
	- ![[Efficacy]]
- Potency only refers to the dose needed to produce effect
