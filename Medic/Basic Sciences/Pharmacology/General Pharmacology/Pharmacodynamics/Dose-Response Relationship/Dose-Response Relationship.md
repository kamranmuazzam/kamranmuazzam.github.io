>Relationship between the dose of a drug and the response elicited by it

This Relationship is measured by a [[Dose-Response Relationship Curve]] 



# Dose-response experiments
Measure the functional response of a drug, which is an indirect assesment of receptor binding

# Threshold(minimal) dose
Least amount needed to produce desired effects

# Maximum effect
Greatest response produced regardless of dose used
