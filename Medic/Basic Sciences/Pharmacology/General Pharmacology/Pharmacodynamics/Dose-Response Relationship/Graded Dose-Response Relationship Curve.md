the more the dose the more will be the response up to a certain limit

# Basic Features

Phase 1 : at low doses
- Curve is flat as response is too low to measure
Phase 2: ↑ doses -> ↑ response
- As dose continues to increase a maximum response is obtained
Phase 3 : at high dose
- further increase of dose will have no increase in effect
- Higher dose may elicit toxicity

# Relationship between the dose and the (intensity of) response 

1. Determines the minimum amount of drug that can be used([[Potency]]) ≃ $ED_{50}$
2. Determines the maximal response that drug can exert($E_{max}$) ≃  maximum height of the curve
3. Determines how much increase in dose is needed to produce the desired response ≃ [[Slope]]

# Parallel Curves
- Produced by several agonists indicate that all act by activating same receptors
