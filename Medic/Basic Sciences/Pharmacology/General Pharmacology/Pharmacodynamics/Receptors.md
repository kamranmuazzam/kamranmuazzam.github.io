>[!quote] Definition
>Receptors are regulatory proteins (macromolecules) which bind endogenous mediators and/or drugs(ligands)

- Most are located on cell surface, few within cell cytoplasm or nucleus
- Specific endogenous mediators (neurotransmitters, hormones or autocaoids) and / or specific drugs (ligands) bind to specific receptors (because of affinity) may produces effect (because of efficiency or intrinsic activity)
# Receptors have two essential functions
1) Recognition of the specific ligand molecule
2) Transduction of the signal into a response
Accordingly, the receptors have a ligand binding domain and an effector domain which undergoes a functional conformatioinal change

# Criteria of Receptors

## <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Saturability</mark>
present in finite numbers

## <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Specificity</mark>
specific drugs bind with specific receptors.
Such as adrenalin has specificity to alpha, beta and dopamine receptors

## <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Selectivity</mark>
Drugs may have selectivity for a group of receptors.
Such as Ach has selectivity to different types of muscarinic receptors

## <mark style="background: #FFB8EBA6;">Reversibility</mark>
binding to receptor is usually reversible and competitive.
Binding must occur by weak forces

# Intracellular Receptor
A model of the interaction of a steroid (eg. cortisol) and its receptor, R, and the sub sequent events in a target cell. The steroid is present in the blood in bound form on the corticosteroid-binding globulin, CBG, but enters the cell as the free molecule. The intracellular receptor is bound to stabilizing proteins - two molecules of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90)

The steroid-receptor dimer complex is able to enter the nucleus, bind to the glucocorticoid response element(GRE) on the gene. The resulting mRNA is edited and exported to the cytoplasm for the production protein that brings about the final hormone response
