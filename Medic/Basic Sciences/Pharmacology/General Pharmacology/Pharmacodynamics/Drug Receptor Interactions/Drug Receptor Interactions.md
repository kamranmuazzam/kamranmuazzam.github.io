After drug-receptor binding

- Drug + [[Receptors|receptor]] -> [DR] complex -> response
or
- Drug + [[Receptors|receptor]] -> [DR] complex -> blockade of [[Receptors|receptor]] without any response

Among four target proteins of specific drug action, receptor is one of them. The following terms are used in describing drug-receptor interaction

1. [[Affinity]]
2. [[Intrinsic Activity]]
3. [[Efficacy]]
4. [[Potency]]
5. [[Agonist]]
6. [[Partial Agonist]]
7. [[Antagonist]]
8. [[Inverse Agonist]]
