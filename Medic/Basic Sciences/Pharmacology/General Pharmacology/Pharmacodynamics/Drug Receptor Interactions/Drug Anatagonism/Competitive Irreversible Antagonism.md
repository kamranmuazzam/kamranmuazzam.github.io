- Antagonist dissociates very slowly or not at all from receptors because of covalent binding antagonism is not reversible by increasing agonist concentration
- Dose response curve in presence of increasing concentration of agonist shifts to the right with reduction in [[Slope]] and [[Maximal Response]]
- [[Agonist]] are unable to reduce [[Receptors|Receptor]] occupancy of antagonist. So [[ED50]] remain unchanged

<mark style="background: #ABF7F7A6;">Occurs with drugs that causes reactive groups forming covalent bond with receptors. These are mainly used as experimental tools and rarely used clinically</mark>
>[!example]
>Adrenaline + Phenoxybenzamine

<mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">An irreversible enzyme inhibitors that acts similarly are clinically used</mark>
>[!example]
>- Aspirin - cyclo oxygenase
>- Omeprazole - $\ce{H+ - K+}$ ATPase
>- Selizilin - mono amino oxidase
