>Restoration of blood flow to ischemic tissues can promote recovery of cells if they are reversibly injured, but can also paradoxically exacerbate the injury and cause cell death

# Mechanism
Several mechanisms have been proposed

1. Oxidative Stress
2. Intracellular Calcium overload
3. Inflammation
4. Activation of the complement system

## Oxidative Stress
- With perfusion there is availability of Oxygen and Nitrogen
- The damaged mitochondria generates more [[Free Radical|ROS]] and RNS

## Intracellular Calcium Overload
- With perfusion more calcium is availabe which increases intracellular calcium
Inflammation

## Inflammation
- Neutrophils can be reqruited as they begin margination after restored blood flow

## Activation of the complement System
- For unknown reasons, some IgM antibodies have a propensity to deposit in ischemic tissues
- When blood flow is resumed, complement proteins bind to deposited antibodies, are activated and cause more cell injury and inflammation
