# Morphological Changes


## Under Light Microscope

1. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Vacuolar Degeneration</mark>
	- Small clear vacuoles may be seen within the cytoplasm; these represent distended and pinced-off segments of the ER.
	- This pattern of nonlethal injury is sometimes called hyrdopic change or vacuolar degeneration
	- Cells may show increased eosinophilic staining
2. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Cellular Swelling</mark>
	- It may be apparent in the whole organ 
	- but it is difficult ot appreaciate with the light microscope


## Under Electron Microscope (ultrastructural changes)

1. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Plasma membrane alterations</mark>
	Such as blebbing, blunting, loss of microvilli
2. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Mitochondrial changes</mark>
	including swelling and the appearance of ==small amorphous densities
3. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Dilation of the ER</mark>
	with detachment of polysome
4. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Accumulation of Myelin figures</mark>
5. <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">Nuclear Alterations</mark>
	with disaggregation of granular and fibrillar elements

# Mechanism of Cell Injury

1. [[Depletion of ATP]]
2. [[Mitochondrial Damage]]
3. [[Influx of Calcium and Loss of Calcium Homeostasis]]
4. [[Accumulation of Oxygen-Derived Free Radicals(Oxidative Stress)]]
5. [[Defects in Membrane Permeability]]
6. [[Damage to DNA and Proteins]]
