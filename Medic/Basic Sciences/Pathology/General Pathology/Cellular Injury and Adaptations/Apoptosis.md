# Causes of Apoptosis

## Apoptosis in Physiological Situations
1. The destruction of cells during embryogenesis | programmed cell death
2. Involution of hormone-dependent tissues upon hormone withdrawal
3. Cell loss in proliferating cell populations
4. Elimination of potentially harmful self-reactive lymphocyte
5. Death of host cells that have served their useful purpose

## Apoptosis in Pathologic Situations
1. DNA damage
2. Accumulation of misfolded proteins
3. Cell death in certain infections
4. Pathologic atrophy in parenchymal organs after duct obstruction
