# Source

1. initially because of release of $\ce{Ca++}$ from intracellular stores
2. Later due to increased influx accross the plasma membrane

# Mechanisms by which intracellular $\ce{Ca^2+}$ causes cell injury

1. accumulation of $\ce{Ca^2+}$ in mitochondria results in ==opening of the mitochonrdial permeability== transition pore and ==failire of ATP generation==
2. Activation of number of enzymes
	1. phospholipases -> cause membrane damage
	2. proteases -> break down both memrbane and cutoskeletal proteins
	3. endonucleases -> responsible for DNA and chromatin fragmentation
	4. ATPases -> hastening ATP depletion
3. induction of apoptosis by ==direct activation of caspases== and by increasesing mitochondrial permeability
