aliases : Reactive Oxygen Species, ROS, Oxygen-Derived Free Radicals
---

>[!quote] Definition
>*Free Radicals* are chemical species that have a single unpaired electron in an outer orbit.

>[!examples]
>Superoxide anion $\ce{O2^.-}$
>Hydrogen Peroxide $\ce{H2O2}$
>Hydroxyl ions $\ce{^. OH}$

# Oxidative Stress
>[!quote] Definition
>Increased Production or decreased scavenging of ROS may lead to an excess of these free radicals, a condition called *oxidative stress*.

# Generation of Free Radicals
1. The reduction-oxidation reactions that occur during normal metabolic processes
2. Absorption of radiant energy
3. Rapid brusts of ROS during inflammation
4. Enzymatic metabolism of exogenous chemicals or drugs
5. Transition metals
6. Nitric Oxide ($\ce{NO}$)

# Removal of Free Radicals
1. Antioxidant
2. Storage and Transport Proteins
3. A series of Enzymes as Catalase, Superoxide dismutases, Glutathione

## Antioxidant
They either block free radical formation or inactivate free radicals
>[!examples]
>lipid soluble vitamin E and A
>ascorbic acid
>glutathione in the cytosol

## Storage and Transport Proteins
- Free iron and copper can catalyze the formation of ROS
- Under normal circumstances, the reactivity of these metals is minimized by their binding to storage and transport proteins
  >[!examples]
  >Transferrin
  >Ferritin
  >Lactoferrin
  >Ceruloplasmin
- This prevents these metals from participating in reactions that generate ROS

## A series of Enzymes as Catalase, Superoxide dismutases, Glutathione

### Catalase
- present in peroxisomes
- decomposes $\ce{H2O2}$
$$\ce{2H2O2 ->[catalase] O2 + H2O}$$
### Superoxide dismutase
- found in many cell types
$$\ce{2O2^.- + 2H -> 2H2O2}$$

# Pathological Effects of Free Radicals

1. Lipid peroxidation in membranes
2. Oxidative modification of proteins
3. Lesions in DNA
