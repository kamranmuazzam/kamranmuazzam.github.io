# Morphological Changes   
   
   
## Under Light Microscope   
   
1. <mark style="background: `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_ADCCFFA6}`;">Vacuolar Degeneration</mark>   
   
	- Small clear vacuoles may be seen within the cytoplasm; these represent distended and pinced-off segments of the ER.   
	- This pattern of nonlethal injury is sometimes called hyrdopic change or vacuolar degeneration   
	- Cells may show increased eosinophilic staining   
2. <mark style="background: `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_ADCCFFA6}`;">Cellular Swelling</mark>   
   
	- It may be apparent in the whole organ    
	- but it is difficult ot appreaciate with the light microscope   
   
   
## Under Electron Microscope (ultrastructural changes)   
   
1. <mark style="background: `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_ADCCFFA6}`;">Plasma membrane alterations</mark>   
	Such as blebbing, blunting, loss of microvilli   
2. <mark style="background: `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_ADCCFFA6}`;">Mitochondrial changes</mark>   
	including swelling and the appearance of ==small amorphous densities   
3. <mark style="background: `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_ADCCFFA6}`;">Dilation of the ER</mark>   
	with detachment of polysome   
4. <mark style="background: `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_ADCCFFA6}`;">Accumulation of Myelin figures</mark>   
5. <mark style="background: `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_ADCCFFA6}`;">Nuclear Alterations</mark>   
	with disaggregation of granular and fibrillar elements
