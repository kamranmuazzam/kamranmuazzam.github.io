# Difference between [Apoptosis](../../../../../Medic/Basic%20Sciences/Pathology/General%20Pathology/Cellular%20Injury%20and%20Adaptations/Apoptosis.md) and [Necrosis](../../../../../Medic/Basic%20Sciences/Pathology/General%20Pathology/Cellular%20Injury%20and%20Adaptations/Necrosis.md)   
   
| Feature                        | Necrosis                                  | Apoptosis                                                                                  |   
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |   
| Cell size                      | Enlarged (swelling)                       | Reduced (shrinkage)                                                                        |   
| Nucleus                        | Pyknosis -> karyorrhexis -> karyolysis    | Fragmentation into nucleosome size fragments                                               |   
| Plasma membrane                | Disrupted                                 | Intact; altered structure, especially orientation of lipids                                |   
| Cellular contents              | Enzymatic digestion; may leak out of cell | Intact; may be released in apoptotic bodies                                                |   
| Adhacent Inflammation          | Frequent                                  | No                                                                                         |   
| Physiologic or Pathologic role | Invariably pathologic                     | Often physiologic, maybe pathologic after some forms of cell injury, especially DNA damage |                               |                                           |                                                                                            |
